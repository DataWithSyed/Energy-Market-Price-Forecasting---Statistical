# Energy-Market-Price-Forecasting---Statistical
This repository hosts a robust, data-driven platform for Energy Market Analysis and Price Forecasting, designed to support high-frequency trading decisions in day-ahead and intraday electricity markets across key European and North American regions.

## Project Overview

This repository hosts a robust, data-driven platform for Energy Market Analysis and Price Forecasting, designed to support high-frequency trading decisions in day-ahead and intraday electricity markets across key European and North American regions.

## Core Functionality

The primary objective is to accurately anticipate short-term price movements in volatile energy markets. This is achieved through the development and deployment of advanced predictive models using statistical time-series methodologies:

* Statistical Time-Series Modeling: Utilizing classical and advanced techniques like ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) for robust, foundational forecasting of short-term price movements.

## Key Contributions & Technical Stack

The project integrates end-to-end data science and engineering workflows:

1. Algorithmic Strategy Development: Designed and rigorously backtested algorithmic trading strategies for both spot and balancing markets, incorporating predictive analytics with real-time operational constraints.
2. Data Pipeline and Analysis: Developed reliable data pipelines using industry-standard Python libraries for efficient Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, visualization, and comprehensive model evaluation.
3. Market Intelligence Integration: Interpreted critical market signals—including merit order dynamics, regional demand forecasts, fuel costs, and regulatory/policy impacts—and translated these complex factors into high-impact features for the forecasting models.
4. Version Control & Collaboration: Maintained rigorous version control using Git Bash to ensure code consistency, reproducibility, and collaborative deployment across the development team.

This platform translates complex energy market data into actionable insights, significantly improving forecast accuracy and informing strategic portfolio optimization for short-term energy trading.
